# Automated Whatsapp 

## I automated the process of sending my grandmother a message once a week.


A fork of Simple-Yet-Hackable-WhatsApp-api, this project greatly improves on the original source code, which was practically unusable. On the otherhand, of all the myriad other solutions out there, this one worked enough to be used as a base (the others were way worse). So thanks to user [**abioluz**](https://github.com/abioluz) for creating [the Simple-Yet-Hackable-WhatsApp-api](https://github.com/abioluz/Simple-Yet-Hackable-WhatsApp-api)

## Update:
Since this approach requires whatsapp web, it not feasible since the idea was to have this script run constantly on a server. Howver, whatsapp web only allows one instance to run at a time and closing a new instance does not automatically re-connect to an older one. Whatsapp sucks. A new, on-phone approach is now being used (using the SKEdit app).
