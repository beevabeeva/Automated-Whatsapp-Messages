# Automated Whatsapp 

## I automated the process of sending my grandmother a message once a week.


A fork of Simple-Yet-Hackable-WhatsApp-api, this project greatly improves on the original source code, which was practically unusable. On the otherhand, of all the myriad other solutions out there, this one worked enough to be used as a base (the others were way worse). So thanks to user [**abioluz**](https://github.com/abioluz) for creating [the Simple-Yet-Hackable-WhatsApp-api](https://github.com/abioluz/Simple-Yet-Hackable-WhatsApp-api)
